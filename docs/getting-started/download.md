# Download

## Get Binaries

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers-py/releases/tag/v0.1.0). You will need the `run-seekers` file. Extract the archive to the destination of your choice. The archive contains a binary executable, all required dependecies and the default configuration. Because all dependencies are already shipped with the archive, no other packages are required to run this project.

## Checkout Examples

You can download the latest examples [here](https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers-py/tree/master/examples). They are useful for testing the binaries, but they are not required to ruhttps://githubn the project.

## Testing Binaries

Now it's time to give Seekers a test! Take your command line in your directory and enter

```sh
run_seekers ./examples/ai-decide.py ./examples/ai-simple.py
```

A new window should open, running the game, which might look similar to the following picture:

If this works, congratulations! Seekers is ready for use now and we can dive into the fun part.
