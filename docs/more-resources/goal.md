# Goal

Goals are physicals. 

A player receives a point when a goal stays in their camp for [`goal.scoring-time`](config#goal) ticks.
* The time spent in a camp is accumulated, that means it can temporarily exit the camp.
* If the goal enters another player's camp, its timer resets.

When a goal is scored, it gets placed at a random location.
